  <p>
    We process personal data exclusively on one of the following legal bases:

  <ul>
    <li>Consent of the data subject</li>
    <li>In order to comply with a legal or contractual obligation</li>
    <li>In the legitimate interest</li>
  </ul>
  <p>In the following, we would like to inform you in particular about what data we process, how and for what purpose it is used and what rights data subjects have. All data is processed by us in compliance with the relevant legal provisions on data protection and data security of the European Union and the Republic of Austria.</p>

    <p><b>Collection and storage of personal data and the nature and purpose of their use</b></p>
    <p><b>a. When visiting the website</b></p>
    <p>
      When you visit our website <u><a href="https://www.amploi.at">https://www.amploi.at</a></u> , information is automatically sent to our website server by the browser used on your end device. This information is temporarily stored in a so-called log file. The following information without direct personal reference (connection data) is collected without your intervention and stored until automatic deletion:

      <li>IP address of the requesting computer,</li>
      <li>Date and time of access,</li>
      <li>Name and URL of the file accessed,</li>
      <li>Website from which the access is made (referrer URL),</li>
      <li>Browser used and, if applicable, the operating system of your computer as well as the name of your access provider.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <br/>
    <p>These data are collected exclusively in anonymised form, which is why it is not possible to draw conclusions about the persons concerned on the basis of these data. This is anonymised system/device data that is processed by us for the following purposes:

      </li>
      <li>For further administrative purposes
      </li>
    </ul>
    <br/>
    <p>
      The legal basis for processing this data is our overriding legitimate interest (pursuant to Art 6 (1) f DSGVO). Our legitimate interest follows from the purposes for data collection listed above. In no case do we use the collected data for the purpose of drawing conclusions about your person. In addition, we use cookies when you visit our website. You can find more detailed explanations on this under points 4 and 5 of this data protection declaration.

In the case of consent, the data is stored until revocation by the data subject, which is possible at any time, whereby the revocation does not affect the permissibility of the processing carried out up to this point.

    </p>
    <p>
      If a service relationship is established, the applicant data will be stored until its termination or beyond for the purposes stated above.
    </p>

    <p><b>e. Data Security</b></p>

      <b>Cookies</b></p>
    <p>We use cookies on our site. These are small files that are automatically created by your browser and stored on your end device (laptop, tablet, smartphone or similar) when you visit our site. Cookies do not cause any damage to your end device and do not contain any viruses, Trojans or other malware. Information is stored in the cookie that is related to the specific end device used. However, this does not mean that we gain direct knowledge of your identity. The use of cookies serves, on the one hand, to make the use of our offer more pleasant for you. We use so-called session cookies to recognise that you have already visited individual pages of our website. These are automatically deleted after you leave our site. In addition, we also use temporary cookies to optimise user-friendliness, which are stored on your end device for a certain fixed period of time. If you visit our site again to use our services, it is automatically recognised that you have already been to our site and which entries and settings you have made so that you do not have to enter them again. On the other hand, we use cookies to statistically record the use of our website and to evaluate it for the purpose of optimising our offer for you (see point 5). These cookies enable us to automatically recognise that you have already been to our website when you visit it again. These cookies are automatically deleted after a defined period of time. The data processed by cookies is necessary for the aforementioned purposes to protect our legitimate interests as well as those of third parties in accordance with Art. 6 (1) p. 1 lit. f DSGVO. Most browsers accept cookies automatically. However, you can configure your browser so that no cookies are stored on your computer or a notice always appears before a new cookie is created. However, the complete deactivation of cookies may mean that you cannot use all the functions of our website.

    <p><b>Analyse-Tools</b>
    </p>
    <p><b>a. Tracking-Tools</b></p>
    <p>The tracking measures listed below and used by us are carried out on the basis of Art. 6 (1) sentence 1 lit. f DSGVO. With the tracking measures used, we want to ensure a needs-based design and the ongoing optimisation of our website. On the other hand, we use the tracking measures to statistically record the use of our website and to evaluate it for the purpose of optimising our offer for you. These interests are to be regarded as legitimate within the meaning of the aforementioned provision. The respective data processing purposes and data categories can be found in the corresponding tracking tools
    </p>
    <p><b>b. Google Analytics</b></p>
    <p>For the purpose of demand-oriented design and continuous optimisation of our pages, we use Google Analytics, a web analytics service provided by Google Inc. (<u><a href="https://www.google.de/intl/de/about/">https://www.google.de/intl/de/about/</a></u>) (1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, USA; hereinafter "Google"). In this context, pseudonymised usage profiles are created and cookies (see under point 4.) are used. The information generated by the cookies about your use of this website such as</p>
    <ul>
      <li>browser type/version,</li>
      <li>operating system used,</li>
      <li>referrer URL (the previously visited page),</li>
      <li>host name of the accessing computer (IP address),
      </li>
      <li>time of the server request
      </li>
    </ul>
    <br/>
    <p>
      will be transmitted to and stored by Google on servers in the United States. The information is used to evaluate the use of the website, to compile reports on website activity and to provide other services associated with the use of the website and the internet for the purposes of market research and demand-oriented design of these internet pages. This information may also be transferred to third parties if this is required by law or if third parties process this data on our behalf. Under no circumstances will your IP address be merged with other Google data. The IP addresses are anonymised so that an allocation is not possible (IP masking). You may refuse the use of cookies by selecting the appropriate settings on your browser, however please note that if you do this you may not be able to use the full functionality of this website. You can also prevent the collection of data generated by the cookie and related to your use of the website (including your IP address) and the processing of this data by Google by downloading and installing a browser add-on (<u><a href="https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=de">https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=de</a></u>). As an alternative to the browser add-on, especially for browsers on mobile devices, you can also prevent the collection by Google Analytics by clicking on this link. An opt-out cookie will be set, which prevents the future collection of your data when visiting this website. The opt-out cookie is only valid in this browser and only for our website and is stored on your device. If you delete the cookies in this browser, you must set the opt-out cookie again. Further information on data protection in connection with Google Analytics can be found, for example, in the Google Analytics help (<u><a href="https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/6004245?hl=de">https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/6004245?hl=de</a></u>).
    </p>
    <p>
      The aggregation of the collected data in your Google account is based exclusively on your consent, which you can give or revoke at Google (Art. 6 para. 1 lit. a DSGVO). In the case of data collection processes that are not merged with your Google account (e.g. because you do not have a Google account or have objected to the merging), the data collection is based on Art. 6 (1) lit. 1 lit. f DSGVO. The legitimate interest results from the fact that the website operator has an interest in the anonymised analysis of website visitors for advertising purposes.
    </p>
    <p><b>c. Google Adwords Conversion Tracking<br/></b></p>
    <p>In order to statistically record the use of our website and to evaluate it for the purpose of optimising our website for you, we also use Google Conversion Tracking. In this process, Google Adwords sets a cookie (see point 4) on your computer if you have accessed our website via a Google ad. These cookies lose their validity after 30 days and are not used for personal identification. If the user visits certain pages of the Adwords customer's website and the cookie has not yet expired, Google and the customer can recognise that the user clicked on the ad and was redirected to this page. Each Adwords customer receives a different cookie. Cookies can therefore not be tracked via the websites of Adwords customers. The information obtained using the conversion cookie is used to create conversion statistics for Adwords customers who have opted for conversion tracking. The Adwords customers learn the total number of users who clicked on their ad and were redirected to a page tagged with a conversion tracking tag. However, they do not receive any information that can be used to personally identify users. If you do not wish to participate in the tracking procedure, you can also refuse the setting of a cookie required for this - for example, by means of a browser setting that generally deactivates the automatic setting of cookies. You can also deactivate cookies for conversion tracking by setting your browser so that cookies from the domain "www.googleadservices.com" are blocked. Google's privacy policy on conversion tracking can be found here (<u><a href="https://services.google.com/sitestats/de.html">https://services.google.com/sitestats/de.html</a></u>).

    <p><b>Social Media Plug-ins</b></p>
    <p>We use social plug-ins from the social networks Facebook, Twitter and Instagram on our website on the basis of Art. 6 (1) sentence 1 lit. f DSGVO in order to raise awareness of our law firm. The underlying promotional purpose is to be regarded as a legitimate interest within the meaning of the DSGVO. The responsibility for data protection-compliant operation is to be ensured by the respective provider. We integrate these plug-ins using the so-called two-click method in order to protect visitors to our website in the best possible way.
    </p>
    <p><b>a. Facebook</b></p>
    <p>Social media plug-ins from Facebook are used on our website to make its use more personal. We use the "LIKE" or "SHARE" button for this purpose. This is an offer from Facebook. When you call up a page of our website that contains such a plug-in, your browser establishes a direct connection with the Facebook servers. The content of the plug-in is transmitted by Facebook directly to your browser, which then integrates it into the website. By integrating the plug-ins, Facebook receives the information that your browser has called up the corresponding page of our website, even if you do not have a Facebook account or are not currently logged in to Facebook. This information (including your IP address) is transmitted by your browser directly to a Facebook server in the USA and stored there. If you are logged in to Facebook, Facebook can assign your visit to our website directly to your Facebook account. If you interact with the plug-ins, for example by clicking the "LIKE" or "SHARE" button, the corresponding information is also transmitted directly to a Facebook server and stored there. The information is also published on Facebook and displayed to your Facebook friends. Facebook may use this information for the purposes of advertising, market research and the needs-based design of Facebook pages. For this purpose, Facebook creates usage, interest and relationship profiles, e.g. to evaluate your use of our website with regard to the advertisements displayed to you on Facebook, to inform other Facebook users about your activities on our website and to provide other services associated with the use of Facebook. If you do not want Facebook to assign the data collected via our website to your Facebook account, you must log out of Facebook before visiting our website. For the purpose and scope of the data collection and the further processing and use of the data by Facebook, as well as your rights in this regard and setting options for protecting your privacy, please refer to Facebook's data protection information (<u><a href="https://www.facebook.com/about/privacy/">https://www.facebook.com/about/privacy/</a></u>).

You can find an overview of tweet buttons at: (<a href="https://about.twitter.com/resources/buttons" target="_blank"><u>https://about.twitter.com/resources/buttons</u></a>).
    </p>
    <p>
      When you call up a page of our website that contains such a plug-in, a direct connection is established between your browser and the Twitter server. Twitter thereby receives the information that you have visited our site with your IP address. If you click the Twitter "tweet button" while you are logged into your Twitter account, you can link the content of our pages on your Twitter profile. This enables Twitter to associate your visit to our pages with your user account. We would like to point out that we, as the provider of the pages, have no knowledge of the content of the transmitted data or its use by Twitter. If you do not wish Twitter to be able to associate your visit to our pages, please log out of your Twitter user account. You can find more information on this in Twitter's privacy policy (<u><a href="https://twitter.com/privacy">https://twitter.com/privacy</a></u>).
    </p>
    <p><b>c. Instagram</b></p>
    <p>Our website also uses so-called social plug-ins ("plug-ins") from Instagram, which is operated by Instagram LLC., 1601 Willow Road, Menlo Park, CA 94025, USA ("Instagram"). The plug-ins are marked with an Instagram logo, for example in the form of an "Instagram camera". When you call up a page of our website that contains such a plug-in, your browser establishes a direct connection to the Instagram servers. The content of the plug-in is transmitted by Instagram directly to your browser and integrated into the page. Through this integration, Instagram receives the information that your browser has called up the corresponding page of our website, even if you do not have an Instagram profile or are not currently logged in to Instagram. This information (including your IP address) is transmitted by your browser directly to an Instagram server in the USA and stored there. If you are logged in to Instagram, Instagram can directly assign your visit to our website to your Instagram account. If you interact with the plug-ins, for example by clicking the "Instagram" button, this information is also transmitted directly to an Instagram server and stored there. The information is also published on your Instagram account and displayed there to your contacts. If you do not want Instagram to directly assign the data collected via our website to your Instagram account, you must log out of Instagram before visiting our website. You can find more information on this in Instagram's privacy policy (<u><a href="https://help.instagram.com/155833707900388">https://help.instagram.com/155833707900388</a></u> ).
